# Workflow Guide

This guide provides a step-by-step walkthrough of how to use AutoCoder to generate a complete, production-ready application.

## Step 1: Describe Your Project

-   **Navigate to the "Generate Code" Page**: This is the main page for project generation.
-   **Write a Detailed Description**: In the text area, describe the application you want to build. The more detail you provide, the better the result will be. Include key features, technologies, and goals.
-   **Select Components**: Use the checkboxes to select the core components you want in your project (e.g., FastAPI backend, Streamlit frontend, Docker deployment).

## Step 2: Answer Clarifying Questions

-   After you submit your description, the **ClarificationAgent** will analyze it and generate a set of questions to fill in any gaps.
-   **Answer Carefully**: Your answers to these questions will directly influence the project's architecture and features.

## Step 3: The Generation Process

-   Once you've answered the questions, the automated generation process will begin. You can watch the progress in real-time.
-   **Agent Collaboration**: You will see the different agents (Architect, Coder, Reviewer) being activated as they work on your project.
-   **Auto-Iteration**: The system will loop through the coding, reviewing, and testing phases until the project reaches a high-quality score. This is normal and is a key part of the process.

## Step 4: Review and Download

-   **Project Complete**: Once the generation is finished, you will be notified.
-   **Download Your Project**: The complete project will be available as a ZIP file for you to download and run on your local machine.
-   **View in History**: The new project will automatically be added to your "Project History" page.

## Step 5: Interact with Your Project

-   **Navigate to the "History" Page**: Find your new project in the list.
-   **Use the Project Chat**: Expand the project and use the chat interface to ask questions about the code, request changes, or get explanations.
-   **Generate Interview Questions**: Use the "Interview Prep" feature to generate a list of technical questions based on your new project's codebase.
