# Core Features

AutoCoder is more than just a code generator. It's a comprehensive development environment with a range of powerful features.

## 1. Dynamic Project Generation

-   **No Templates**: Unlike other tools that rely on rigid templates, AutoCoder designs every project's architecture from scratch based on your specific requirements.
-   **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: A team of specialized AI agents (for architecture, coding, testing, etc.) work together to build your project, ensuring expert-level quality at every stage.

## 2. Interactive Development

-   **Clarification Phase**: Before any code is written, the system asks intelligent questions to ensure it understands your exact needs.
-   **Project Chat**: After a project is generated, you can "chat" with it. An AI agent with full context of the codebase can answer your questions, explain how things work, and even make changes for you.

## 3. Automated Quality Assurance

-   **Auto-Iteration Workflow**: The system doesn't just write code once. It writes the code, reviews it, tests it, and then *iteratively improves it* until it meets a high-quality score.
-   **Comprehensive Code Reviews**: A dedicated team of AI reviewers analyzes the code for readability, performance, security, and logical errors.
-   **Automatic Test Generation**: The TestingAgent automatically writes `pytest` unit tests to ensure the generated code is reliable.

## 4. Project Management & History

-   **Project History**: All your generated projects are saved and can be viewed, downloaded, or interacted with at any time.
-   **Upload Existing Projects**: You can upload your own projects (as ZIP files) to add them to the history and use the Project Chat feature on your own code.

## 5. Interview Preparation

-   **Code-Aware Questions**: For any project in your history, you can generate a list of complex, in-depth interview questions. The AI analyzes the project's specific code and generates questions that are directly relevant to its implementation.
