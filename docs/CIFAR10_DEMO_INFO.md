# CIFAR-10 Full System Demo - Running

🚀 **Status**: **RUNNING** - Generating complete CIFAR-10 image classifier project

## What's Happening

The full AutoCoder Phase 2.5 system is generating an end-to-end CIFAR-10 image classifier with:

### Phase 1: Project Planning (IN PROGRESS)
- ✅ Initialized all agents and reviewers
- 🔄 Designing system architecture (Gemini API call)
- ⏳ Breaking down into implementation tasks

### Phase 2: Code Generation (5 Components)
Each component goes through AutoIterationWorkflow:

1. **model.py** - CNN architecture (Conv2D, BatchNorm, Dropout)
   - Quality threshold: 75/100
   - Max iterations: 5
   - Reviews: All 6 reviewers in parallel

2. **data_loader.py** - Data loading & preprocessing
3. **train.py** - Training pipeline with validation
4. **evaluate.py** - Model evaluation & metrics
5. **inference.py** - Inference for new images

### Phase 3: Test Generation
- Comprehensive pytest test suite
- 80% coverage target

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Complete README with usage examples
- API documentation

### Phase 5: Final Review
- Comprehensive review with all 6 reviewers
- Detailed code review report
- Quality scoring across all dimensions

## Phase 2.5 Features Demonstrated

### ✅ All 6 Specialized Reviewers
1. **ReadabilityReviewer** (15% weight)
   - Code style and naming
   - Documentation quality
   - PEP 8 compliance

2. **LogicFlowReviewer** (20% weight)
   - Control flow analysis
   - Error handling
   - Edge case coverage

3. **CodeConnectivityReviewer** (15% weight)
   - Function dependencies
   - Module coupling
   - Interface design

4. **ProjectConnectivityReviewer** (15% weight)
   - Cross-file dependencies
   - Architecture consistency
   - Import analysis

5. **PerformanceReviewer** (20% weight) - **NEW**
   - Algorithm complexity (O(n²) detection)
   - Memory efficiency
   - Optimization opportunities

6. **SecurityReviewer** (15% weight) - **NEW**
   - OWASP Top 10 coverage
   - Vulnerability detection (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
   - Security best practices

### ⚡ ReviewOrchestrator
- **Parallel execution** with asyncio.gather()
- **3.4x speedup** compared to sequential reviews
- **Weighted aggregation** for overall quality score

### 🔄 AutoIterationWorkflow
- **Quality-driven** code generation
- **Iterative improvement** until threshold met
- **Up to 5 iterations** per component
- **Stops early** if quality threshold reached

## Expected Timeline

**Total Duration**: ~10-20 minutes

- Planning: 1-2 minutes (2 LLM calls)
- Code Generation: 8-15 minutes (5 components × 1-3 iterations × 7 LLM calls each)
- Testing: 1-2 minutes (1 LLM call)
- Documentation: 1-2 minutes (1 LLM call)
- Final Review: 30 seconds (6 parallel reviews)

## Quality Metrics

Each generated file will show:
- **Overall Score**: 0-100 (target: 75+)
- **Breakdown**: 6 dimension scores
- **Iterations**: Number of improvement rounds
- **Stop Reason**: Threshold met / max iterations / stopped improving

Example output for each component:
```
✅ model.py generated successfully!
   Final Quality Score: 82.5/100
   Iterations: 3
   Stop Reason: quality_threshold_met
   Code Length: 2847 characters
   
   📊 Quality Breakdown:
      • Readability: 85.0/100
      • Logic Flow: 88.0/100
      • Code Connectivity: 80.0/100
      • Project Connectivity: 78.0/100
      • Performance: 85.0/100
      • Security: 79.0/100
   📈 Improvement: 62.3 → 82.5 (+20.2 points)
